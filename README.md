# Volatile Demonstration

A demonstration of volatile variables and atomicity

### Description

This repository was created to settle a debate about the architecture-specific handling of the keyword "volatile" and it's
iteraction with the increment (++) operator and whether this was atomicly compiled on different architectures. This code was
meant to be compiled on different systems to see how they handle these operations.
